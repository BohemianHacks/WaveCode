# WaveCode

Waveform Based Visual Encoding

1. Advantages of a waveform-based encoding over QR codes:
- Continuous data representation vs binary blocks
- Potential for multi-dimensional encoding (amplitude, frequency, phase)
- Opportunity for error correction through mathematical properties
- Could be more visually appealing

This implementation provides several key features:

1. Multi-dimensional encoding:
- Amplitude variation
- Frequency modulation
- Phase shifting
- Polynomial patterns

2. Advantages over QR codes:
- Continuous data representation allows for more information per space
- Multiple encoding dimensions increase data density
- Built-in error correction through mathematical properties
- More visually appealing presentation

3. Potential improvements could include:
- Color channels for additional data layers
- Wavelet transformations for compression
- Advanced error correction using Reed-Solomon codes
- Machine learning-based optimization of wave patterns
- Adaptive scaling based on data content

The current implementation could be extended to include:
1. Color-based encoding for 3x data density
2. Fractal patterns for nested information
3. Compression algorithms to reduce redundancy
4. More sophisticated error correction
